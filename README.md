# PortfolioProjects
Projects that I have created to display my coding ability:

AI Assistant: a personal ai assistant, similar to Siri, whihc is an ongoing project.

Handwritten Digit Recognition: the combination of machine learning and data pulling to allow
                               a computer to recognize handwritten numbers.

Expense Tracker: a simple, personal expense tracker. Simply input your monthly income and your budget
                 for different categories. Every time you input an expense, and which category it belongs
                 to, it will inform you the budget you have remaining for that category. The data gets
                 recorded in an excel sheet.
